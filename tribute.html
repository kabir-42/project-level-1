                    born 8 July 1972), affectionately known as Dada (meaning "elder brother" in Bengali),

                    who is the 39th and current president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
                    He is popularly honoured as Maharaja of Indian Cricket.[by whom?] During his playing career,
                    Ganguly established himself as one of the world's leading batsmen and also one of the most
                    successful captains of the Indian national cricket team.[1][2][3] While batting, he was 
                    especially prolific through the off side, earning himself the nickname God of the Off Side 
                    for his elegant stroke play square of the wicket and through the covers.
